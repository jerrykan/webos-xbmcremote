Installation Notes
------------------
Ensure that the webOS SDK is installed[1] and the touchpad is attached via
USB:

    $ cd <webos-xbmcremote dir>
    $ palm-package .
    $ palm-install com.jerrykan.app.xbmcremote_<version>_all.ipk

The application should now be installed on your Touchpad and can be launched
like any other application.

Be sure to set the XBMC host in the preferences, which can be accessed via the
menu.
